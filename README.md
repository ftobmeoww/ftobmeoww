# Hi there, I'm ftob(retard) 

Uhh... I like cats and dogs. Did I mention I **really** like cats and dogs?? 

I‚Äôm just a chill dev who loves messing around with code and building cool stuff.  
Mostly working with **Python**, **C++**, and **HTML** ‚Äî but always down to learn more!

### üõ†Ô∏è What I do

- Write Python scripts that actually work (most of the time) 
- Dive into C++ when I want some low-level power 
- Build basic (and sometimes fancy) websites with HTML & a bit of CSS
